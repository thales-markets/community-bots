This is why claiming rewards was required to qualify, as it demonstrates a healthy c-ratio maintenance.\n\nThese retro pro-rata rewards are unlocked on a weekly basis for 100 weeks.\n\n There is a floor set up for minimum amount, meaning that if your aggregated rewards end up being below 24 THALES, you are not eligible for the pro-rata distribution. Every SNX staker who claimed at least once will receive 137 THALES token as an airdrop to compensate for those whose SNX stack wasn't big enough compared to the total debt to grant them an ongoing distribution."
